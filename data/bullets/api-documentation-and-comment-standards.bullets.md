## API documentation and comment standards
- Last [updated](/node/1354/discuss) on
- 4 June 2025
- Note: Changes to Drupal coding standards are proposed and discussed in issues in the [Coding Standards project](/project/coding_standards).
- This page covers:
- How to write documentation for PHP code so that the API module can successfully parse it and display it on [http://api.drupal.org](http://api.drupal.org) (and other similar sites).
- The purpose of the Drupal project's standards for API documentation and comments in PHP code is to ensure that the API module can parse/display the documentation, programmers looking at the PHP files can read/understand the documentation, and integrated developer environments (IDEs) can work successfully with the code and documentation.
- A reference to the tags used in this documentation.

## [](#s-notes-and-standards "Permalink to this headline")Notes and standards

## [](#general "Permalink to this headline")General considerations for API module parsing
- The API module parses documentation and code in PHP files, and it expects documentation to be in a format similar to other code/documentation parsing systems such as PHPDoc, JavaDoc, etc. It was originally based on [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html), but it has evolved into something that has its own set of tags and a lot of Drupal-specific functionality.
- The API module parses documentation that is in special documentation blocks (known as "docblocks" in the rest of this document).
- Syntax example:
- Sample summary line.
- Next paragraph. Etc.
- (code being documented goes here, such as a function declaration, class, etc.)`
- General notes on the API module and the documentation it will parse:
- The API module treats files with the following extensions as PHP: .php, .module, .inc, .install, .engine., .theme, .profile, and .test.
- When parsing a PHP file, the API module parses both documentation and PHP code. PHP files with syntax errors could cause problems.
- The special documentation tags described in this document are only recognized within special PHP comment blocks that start with `/**`. These are known in this document as *docblocks*.
- In-code comment lines starting with `//` and comment blocks starting with `/*` are not recognized as docblocks.
- Docblocks normally have `*` at the beginning of each line, and the API module strips these out when formatting the documentation (see example above).
- To make a paragraph break in a docblock, leave a blank line (see example above). Some tags also trigger paragraph breaks: `@param`, `@return`, `@see`, `@var`. The API module does not support blank lines within a single tag's documentation (for example, within a single parameter's documentation with `@param`.
- The API module itself does not care about line length (Drupal documentation standards do, however, see below).
- The first paragraph of a docblock is known as the *summary*.
- To document a function, class, etc., the docblock must appear directly before the item being documented, with no blank line in between (see example above). There are also a few "free-standing" docblocks (for documenting files and making topics -- see tag reference for details).
- The API module automatically turns the names of functions, classes, etc. that it recognizes in documentation text into links to the documentation of those items.

## [](#drupal "Permalink to this headline")General documentation
- In the individual tag references, there are notes about Drupal standards that pertain to that particular tag. This section contains standards related to all API docblocks.
- Syntax example:
- Sample summary line.
- Next paragraph. Etc.
- (code being documented goes here, such as a function declaration, class, etc.)`
- Drupal standards notes:
- All documentation and comments should form proper sentences, use proper grammar and punctuation, and generally follow the same style guidelines as Drupal.org content: [http://drupal.org/style-guide/content](http://drupal.org/style-guide/content)
- Put a space between the comment character (the \* or the //) and the first letter of the sentence.
- Document the current version of code, not differences from past code or future plans (except for [@todo](#todo) and [@deprecated](#deprecated) tags).
- Sentences should be separated by single spaces.
- Comments and variable names should be in English, and use US English spelling (e.g., "color" not "colour").
- To refer to a module or theme, use wording and capitalization like "the Foo Bar module" (in other words, the module/theme name is a proper noun, not including the word "module" or "theme" in the proper noun).
- All caps are used in comments only when referencing constants, for example TRUE.
- Docblocks must have `*` at the beginning of each line (see sample above).
- Lines containing comments (including docblocks) must wrap as close to 80 characters as possible without going over, with a few exceptions (noted in the Tag Reference below).
- Lines after tags such as `@param`, `@return`, etc. that contain documentation connected with that tag are indented two spaces. See syntax examples for each tag.
- Every function, constant, class, interface, class member (function, property, constant), and file must be documented, even private class members.
- All summaries (first lines of docblocks) must be under 80 characters, start with a capital letter, and end with a period (.). They must provide a brief description of what a function does, what a class does, what a file contains, etc.
- When implementing a hook, use a short summary of the form "Implements hook\_menu().". Omit the parameter and return value documentation in this case.

## [](#classes "Permalink to this headline")Classes and namespaces
- The following standards apply to documenting classes and using namespaces in Drupal API documentation:
- All classes and all of their methods (including private methods but excluding constructors) must be documented.
- If a class has a method that is overriding a method from a parent class/interface, and the documentation is identical, use this short form for the documentation:
- {@inheritdoc}
- public function …`
- Use a third person verb to start the summary of a class, interface, or method. For example: "Represents a ..." or "Provides...".
- Document exceptions with [@throws](#throws).
- If you use a namespace on a class anywhere in documentation, always make sure it is a fully-qualified namespace (beginning with a backslash).
- Immediately after an @tag (@param, @return, @var, etc.), class and interface names must always include the fully-qualified namespace.
- Other namespace-related standards for Drupal are under discussion and have not yet been adopted permanently.

## [](#types "Permalink to this headline")Data types in documentation
- Tags that indicate the type of a variable, of a parameter, or of the return value of a function/method (`@var`, `@param`, `@return`) are compliant with the [PHPDoc Type syntax](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types) as documented by PHPStan. This allows advanced static analysis of Drupal codebase.
- Drupal standards notes:
- Use interface names if possible, or the most general possible class, in place of a specific class.
- Always prefix types with the fully-qualified namespace for classes and interfaces (beginning with a backslash). If the class/interface is in the global namespace, prefix by a backslash.
- You may omit the description if using `@return $this` or `@return static`.
- Spell the following types accordingly
- array (NOT "Array").
- bool (NOT "boolean" or "Boolean"). If only TRUE or only FALSE is a possible value, rather than either one being possible, use true or false instead of bool.
- true (NOT "TRUE", see bool)
- false (NOT "FALSE", see bool)
- int (NOT "integer")
- null (NOT "NULL")
- object (NOT "stdClass")

## [](#functions "Permalink to this headline")Functions
- Documenting functions is somewhat more complex than documenting other types of PHP language constructs, so they have their own coding standards:
- Each parameter of a function must be documented with a `@param` tag (see exceptions below).
- If a function has a return value, it must be documented with a `@return` tag (see exceptions below).
- If there is no return value for a function, there must not be a `@return` tag.
- For **most functions** (see exceptions below), summary lines must start with a third person singular present tense verb, and they must explain what the function does. Example: "Calculates the maximum weight for a list."
- Functions that are easily described in one line may be documented by providing the function summary line only (omitting all parameters and return value).
- In addition, there are standards for documenting specific special types of functions:

## [](#hooks "Permalink to this headline")Hook definition
- The summary starts with an imperative verb that tells why a module would want to implement the hook. Example: "Respond to node deletion." Hook definitions are placed in a `.api.php` file, which is not directly loaded by Drupal. Each is a fake function whose name starts with "hook", and whose function body is a sample implementation. Parameters and return value that the implementer must use need to be documented.

## [](#hookimpl "Permalink to this headline")Hook implementation
- Documentation uses a short format:
- Implements hook_help().
- function blog_help($section) {`
- If appropriate, you can add additional details pertinent to the particular hook implementation in a separate paragraph after the summary. Do not document parameters and return value though -- these are documented on the hook definition referenced in the summary line. And if the hook name has a variable portion:
- Implements hook_form_FORM_ID_alter() for node_type_form().
- function mymodule_form_node_type_form_alter(&$form, &$form_state) {`

## [](#updateN "Permalink to this headline")Update functions (implementations of hook\_update\_N())
- These hooks use a different syntax because the documentation summary (the first line) is displayed to users running update.php to tell them which updates need to run. So they are documented like in the following comment.
- Add several fields to the {node_revision} table.
- Longer description can go here, if necessary.
- function module_name_update_7002() {`
- Note that the first line should start with an imperative verb.

## [](#callbacks "Permalink to this headline")Callbacks for built-in PHP functions
- Many PHP functions, such as uasort() etc., require the caller to pass in a [callback function](http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.pseudo-types.php#language.types.callback). When documenting a function that is intended to be used as a callback in this way, start with a standard function summary line. After the summary, the next paragraph should indicate what function the callback is passed to, and which Drupal function makes use of it (which could be a list of functions). Example:
- [standard first line]
- Callback for uasort() within system_themes_page().`

## [](#callback-def "Permalink to this headline")Callback definitions and implementations
- Like standard PHP functions, sometimes the Drupal API also needs callbacks to operate. In this context, a "callback" is a function that a module needs to define in conjunction with a hook implementation, batch set, plugins, or other Drupal functionality.
- In order to document the parameters and return value of callbacks, make a callback function definition, with a documentation block, in a \*.api.php file, similar to hook definition documentation (i.e., they are "dummy" functions in files that are not actually loaded, but they can be referenced in other documentation). Then, in the hook or other function that requires the implementer/caller to return a callback function name, refer to this callback definition function by name.
- Callback definition function names in the \*.api.php file should start with "callback\_", followed by a descriptive name.
- Callback definition function bodies should be an example implementation (like hook definition function bodies).
- The one-line documentation summary should describe what the callback does. The summary starts with an imperative verb that tells why a module would want to define this callback.
- The next line should start with "Callback for \_\_\_:" (replace \_\_\_ with the name of the hook, function, or other component that uses the callback).
- They should be added to the "@ingroup callbacks" topic.
- The hook or other function that uses the callback should refer to the callback definition function by name in its documentation.
- An actual callback function in module code should have as its one-line documentation summary "Implements callback\_NAME().", so that its documentation links to the callback documentation.
- `// In *.api.php file:
- Perform tasks when a batch is complete.
- Callback for batch_set().
- @param bool $success
- A boolean indicating whether the batch operation successfully concluded.
- @param int $results
- The results from the batch process.
- @param array $operations
- The batch operations that remained unprocessed. Only relevant if $success
- @ingroup callbacks
- function callback_batch_finished($success, $results, $operations) {
- // Sample code here.
- // Documentation for batch_set():
- - finished: Name of an implementation of callback_batch_finished(). This is
- executed after the batch has
- completed. This should be used to perform any result massaging that may
- be needed, and possibly save data in $_SESSION for display after final
- page redirection.
- // Note: especially in Drupal 8, these callback implementations may be
- // class methods rather than functions, which are passed in as PHP
- // callables rather than strings. So an alternate wording that
- // implies that this is also acceptable would be:
- - finished: A callable that implements callback_batch_finished().
- // Actual callback: _node_mass_update_batch_finished() function.
- Implements callback_batch_finished().
- function _node_mass_update_batch_finished($success, $results, $operations) {
- Example 2 (entity URI callback, D7 only):
- `// In *.api.php file:
- Return the URI for an entity.
- Callback for hook_entity_info().
- @param $entity
- The entity to return the URI for.
- An associative array with element 'path' giving the URL path, and 'options' giving options for
- the url() function.
- @ingroup callbacks
- function callback_entity_info_uri($entity) {
- 'path' => 'node/' . $entity->nid,
- // Documentation for hook_entity_info() in the @return section:
- - uri callback: The name of an implementation of callback_entity_info_uri().
- - uri callback: A callable implementing callback_entity_info_uri().
- // Actual callback: node_uri() function.
- Implements callback_entity_info_uri().
- function node_uri($node) {
- 'path' => 'node/' . $node->nid,

## [](#forms "Permalink to this headline")Form-generating functions
- The form constructor, validation handler(s), and submission handler(s) form a set and are documented as in this sample:
- Form constructor for the user login form.
- @param string $message
- The message to display.
- @see user_login_form_validate()
- @see user_login_form_submit()
- @ingroup forms
- function user_login_form($form, &$form_state, $message = '') {
- Form validation handler for user_login_form().
- @see user_login_form_submit()
- function user_login_form_validate($form, &$form_state) {
- Form submission handler for user_login_form().
- @see user_login_form_validate()
- function user_login_form_submit($form, &$form_state) {
- Omit `@param` and `@return` documentation for the standard parameters and return value (such as `$form` and `$form_state`.
- Document parameters specific to this form constructor.

## [](#menu-callback "Permalink to this headline")hook\_menu() page router callback functions
- Note: This standard was adopted for Drupal version 8.x, which is a bit ironic since Drupal 8.x subsequently did away with hook\_menu() itself. The standard still applies to the callbacks used by the router, although they are not technically hook\_menu() callbacks any more.
- Sample syntax:
- Page callback: Displays a list of content.
- Longer description can go here.
- @param string $foo
- Description of a parameter for this page.
- @return array
- A render array for a page containing a list of content.
- @see node_menu()
- (function here)`
- Drupal standards notes:
- In the first line, declare what type of callback it is (Page callback, Access callback, etc.), and give a short description of what it does (like you would for any function). Total line length: 80 characters, ending in "."
- At the end, include an @see line that points to the hook\_menu() implementation where this callback is registered. If multiple hook implementations use the callback, include one @see line for each.
- Form constructors that are used as page callbacks should have a first line like "Page callback: Constructs a form for ...".

## [](#render "Permalink to this headline")Render API callback functions
- The Render API uses various callback functions, which you can assign to a render element when setting up a render array (or a form). Generally, they are documented without parameters or return value documentation, since the parameters and return value are standard for that type of callback. The summary line should be "Render API callback:" followed by a description of what the function does, conforming to the usual function summary standards. In addition, somewhere in the function, there should be a paragraph saying where the callback is assigned and what particular Render API callback it is being used for.
- Syntax example:
- Render API callback: Validates the maximum upload size field.
- Ensures that a size has been entered and that it can be parsed by
- parse_size().
- This function is assigned as an #element_validate callback in
- file_field_instance_settings_form().
- function _file_generic_settings_max_filesize($element, &$form_state, $form) {`

## [](#themeable "Permalink to this headline")Themeable functions
- Themeable functions (`theme_foo()`, for example -- functions meant to be called via `theme()` and overrideable by the theme) are documented using these standards:
- The first line should be "Returns HTML for a ..."
- All components of the `$variables` array (or other arguments) need to be documented.
- They should have `@ingroup themeable` in their documentation.
- Syntax example:
- Returns HTML for a foo.
- @param array $variables
- An associative array containing:
- - foo: The foo object that is being formatted.
- - show_bar: TRUE to show the bar component, FALSE to omit it.
- @ingroup themeable
- function theme_foo($variables) {`

## [](#themepreprocess "Permalink to this headline")Template preprocess functions
- Template preprocess functions (template\_preprocess\_container(), for example) are documented using these standards:
- The first line should be "Prepares variables for \[description of foo\] templates."
- The second line should be "Default template: foo-bar.html.twig" where foo-bar.html.twig is the filename of the default template file.
- All components of the $variables array need to be documented.
- Syntax example:
- Prepares variables for container templates.
- Default template: container.html.twig.
- @param array $variables
- An associative array containing:
- - element: An associative array containing the properties of the element.
- Properties used: #id, #attributes, #children.
- function template_preprocess_container(&$variables) {`

## [](#inline "Permalink to this headline")In-line code comments
- Non-header or in-line comments are strongly encouraged. A general rule of thumb is that if you look at a section of code and think "Wow, I don't want to try and describe that", you need to comment it before you forget how it works. Comments should be on a separate line immediately before the code line or block they reference. For example:
- `// Unselect all other contact categories.
- db_query("UPDATE {contact} SET selected = 0");`
- If each line of a list needs a separate comment, the comments may be given on the same line and may be formatted to a uniform indent for readability.
- C style comments (`/* */`) and standard C++ comments (`//`) are both fine, though the former is discouraged within functions (even for multiple lines, repeat the `//` single-line comment). Use of Perl/shell style comments (`#`) is discouraged.
- `@todo` statements in inline comments follow the same rules as [using the @todo tag in docblocks](#todo). An example:
- `// Some other comment here.
- // @todo Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam
- //   nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat,
- //   sed diam voluptua.
- // We explicitly delete all comments.
- comment_delete($cid);`
- The `@var` tag can document variables in addition to class properties. This can be used when you know more about the type of a variable than is self-evident from the code, such as when you load a specific entity type, or a specific service. In this case you can typehint inline, which improves Developer Experience and Tools Experience. For example:
- `/** @var \Drupal\node\NodeInterface $node */
- $node = $this->entityTypeManager->getStorage('node')->load(123);`
- When documenting variables with the `@var` tag note that you should use the special `/** */` delimiters with a double opening asterisk. Always use the fully qualified namespace of the class or interface, and include the name of the variable at the end.

## [](#lists "Permalink to this headline")Lists in documentation
- The API module creates nested bullet lists from lines starting with `-` in docblocks.
- Syntax example:
- `* Lists are usually preceded by a line ending in a colon:
- - Item in the list.
- - Another item, with a sub-list:
- - key: Sub-list with keys, first item.
- - key2: (optional) Second item with a key.
- - Back to the outer list. Sometimes list items are quite long, in which case
- you can wrap the text like this.
- - Last item in the outer list.
- Text that is outside of the list continues here.`
- Syntax notes:
- A hyphen as the first character on the line (except the `*`) indicates a list item.
- All list items at the same nesting level must be indented the same amount.
- There must not be blank lines between items in the same list.
- If a list has "keys" (for instance, a list describing an associative array, or the options for a parameter), use a colon between the key and its description. The API module will format keys with a `strong` tag.
- Drupal standards notes:
- The line before a list or before a new level of nesting must end with a colon (:).
- The hyphen aligns with the start of the text containing that level of list, which means that each level of nesting indents by two spaces.
- Array keys are not put in quotes; keys describing literal strings (such as parameter values) should be put in quotes.
- Indicate optional list items with `(optional)` and default list items with `(default)`. With keys, these words are placed just after the colon.

## [](#templates "Permalink to this headline")Theme template files
- The default implementations for PHP theme template files (\*.tpl.php) start with a documentation block that follows the generic standards for [@file](#file) blocks.
- Note: There is a separate page on [documenting Twig templates](http://drupal.org/node/1823416).
- Syntax example:
- Displays a list of forums.
- Available variables:
- - $forums: An array of forums to display. Each $forum in $forums contains:
- - $forum->is_container: Is TRUE if the forum can contain other forums. Is
- FALSE if the forum can contain only topics.
- - $forum->depth: How deep the forum is in the current hierarchy.
- - $forum->name: The name of the forum.
- - $forum->link: The URL to link to this forum.
- @see template_preprocess_forum_list()
- @ingroup themeable
- (template markup/code starts here)`
- Drupal standards notes:
- The variables that are set up in the template\_preprocess function should be documented.
- Do not include `@ingroup themeable` in overridden template files in a theme -- only in the base template (supplied by the module that defined the theme hook). Otherwise, theme-specific versions are documented the same way.
- If any variable contains data that has not been sanitized, this should be noted.
- Always include an @see reference to the preprocess function.

## [](#order "Permalink to this headline")Order of documentation sections
- Docblocks for functions, classes, and other PHP items should be written in the following order to comply with Drupal coding standards. Omit sections that don't apply (for instance, `@param` only applies to functions). Separate different-type sections by a blank line (for instance, all the `@param` documentation goes together, with a blank line before the first parameter and a blank line after the last parameter before the `@return` section starts). Here's the order:
- One-line summary, ending in a period (.).
- Additional paragraph(s) of explanation.
- [@var](#var)
- [@param](#param)
- [@return](#return)
- [@throws](#throws)
- [@ingroup](#defgroup)
- [@deprecated](#deprecated)
- [@see](#see)
- [@todo](#todo)
- [@Plugin](#Plugin) and other annotations

## [](#tests "Permalink to this headline")PHPUnit and Simpletest tests
- PHPUnit and Simpletest classes should generally follow the Class standards of the previous section, but there are some differences and specifics to be aware of, such as the @group, @covers, and @coversDefaultClass tags. See:
- [https://www.drupal.org/node/2500059](https://www.drupal.org/node/2500059) (Simpletest)
- [https://www.drupal.org/node/2116043](https://www.drupal.org/node/2116043) (PHPUnit)

## [](#s-tag-reference "Permalink to this headline")Tag reference

## [](#code "Permalink to this headline")@code: Code samples
- The `@code ... @endcode` tag is used to embed code samples in docblock text. The API module will attempt to format the contents as PHP code when displaying the documentation.
- Syntax example:
- `* Example usage:
- mymodule_print('Hello World!');
- Text to immediately follow the code block.`
- Drupal standards: Put the `@code` and `@endcode` tags on their own lines. Do not use a blank line between the text that explains the code sample and the code sample itself.

## [](#defgroup "Permalink to this headline")@defgroup, @addtogroup, @ingroup, @{, @}: Groups and topics
- The `@defgroup` tag is used to define a "group" (in Doxygen terms), which the API module displays as a Topic page. A `@defgroup` tag needs to be in its own docblock (not inside a file description docblock, function docblock, class docblock, etc.). A group defined by `@defgroup` has an identifier (starting with a letter, and composed of numbers, letters, underscores, periods, and hyphens), a title, a summary, and documentation. In addition, individual "items" (files, functions, classes, and other things that are documented with docblocks in the API module) can be designated as being "in" the group. The API module makes a page for each group/topic, and on the page, it lists all of the items that are part of the group.
- The examples below show how to define a group using the `@defgroup` tag, and three different ways to define the members of the group, using tags `@{`, `@}`, `@addtogroup`, and `@ingroup`.
- Syntax example 1 for defining a group:
- @defgroup group_identifier Topic title goes here
- Summary line for the group/topic goes here.
- Additional documentation paragraphs go here.
- Syntax example 2 for defining a group and adding members to it at the same time:
- @defgroup group_identifier Topic title goes here
- Summary line for the group/topic goes here.
- Additional documentation paragraphs go here.
- (functions, classes, etc. that belong as members of the group go here)
- @} End of "defgroup group_identifier".
- Syntax example for adding several items as members of an existing group:
- @addtogroup group_identifier
- (functions, classes, etc. that belong as members of the group go here)
- @} End of "addtogroup group_identifier".
- Syntax example for adding one item as a member of a group:
- `* (inside the docblock for this item)
- @ingroup group_identifier`
- Syntax notes:
- Only define each group identifier once with a `@defgroup` tag. To add more functions to the group that are in a separate file or location, use either `@addtogroup` or `@ingroup`.
- Every docblock within `@{ ... @}` is included in the group. This means that if a class is within these tags, not only the class itself, but also its members will be included in the group. You probably don't want that -- so use `@ingroup` to add a class to a group (putting the tag in the class's docblock).
- `@defgroup` needs to be its own docblock (do not include it in a docblock for a function, file description, class, etc.).
- Drupal standards notes:
- Use groups sparingly. Each group makes a topic page. Only use groups if there is some reference information you need to impart, related to several different functions or classes or constants. If information pertains to only one function, for instance, just put the information in that one function's docblock.

## [](#deprecated "Permalink to this headline")@deprecated: Indicating deprecated functionality
- The `@deprecated` tag is placed in a documentation block to indicate that a function, method, or class has been deprecated and should not be used, but has not yet been removed.
- `@deprecated in %deprecation-version% and is removed from %removal-version%. %extra-info%.
- @see %cr-link%`
- Syntax notes
- %deprecation-version%
- The **version string** representing when the change occurred.
- For Drupal core and contrib projects that use semantic versioning, the version string is:
- `project:major.minor.patch` or
- `project:major.minor.patch-tag[n]`
- For contrib projects that use legacy core-compatibility-prefixed versioning, the version string is:
- `project:8.x-minor.patch` or
- `project:8.x-minor.patch-tag[n]`
- %removal-version%
- The **version string** representing when the deprecated code path will be removed.
- %extra-info%
- This is free text. Useful things to include are hints on how to correct the code, what replacement to use, etc.
- The link to the change record on drupal.org (for core deprecations) or the relevant issue.

## [](#event "Permalink to this headline")@Event: Documenting events
- The `@Event` tag is used to indicate that the thing being documented is the name of an event triggered by the event dispatcher. The documentation should include information about when/why the event is triggered and what type of object event subscribers will receive.
- Event documentation should use [@see](#see) to indicate the class + method where the event is triggered, as well as an example implementation of subscribing to the event in question.
- Short description of event.
- Longer description of event, including information about the type of
- object passed to the event listener method.
- const REQUEST = 'kernel.request';`

## [](#file "Permalink to this headline")@file: Documenting files
- The `@file` tag is placed in a docblock to indicate it is documentation for the file as a whole. The API module will only recognize one file docblock per file (the first one; there shouldn't be more than one).
- Syntax example:
- The theme system, which controls the output of Drupal.
- The theme system allows for nearly all output of the Drupal system to be
- customized by user themes.
- Syntax notes:
- As in other docblocks, the first paragraph in the file docblock is used as a summary, and the rest is additional documentation. The docblock must be followed by a blank line, and must not contain `@defgroup` or `@mainpage` tags.
- Drupal standards: If a file docblock summary begins with a verb, it should be in third person singular present tense, such as "Handles file uploads." The summary should be one line of up to 80 characters ending in ".".
- Drupal sample for module .install files:
- Install, update, and uninstall functions for the Foo Bar module.
- The @file doc block MUST be present for PHP files, with the following exceptions:
- Files that contain a namespaced class/interface/trait, whose file name is the class name with a .php extension, and whose file path is closely related to the namespace (under PSR-4 or a similar standard), SHOULD NOT have a @file documentation block.
- The core \\Drupal class's Drupal.php file (which does not have a namespace).

## [](#inheritdoc "Permalink to this headline"){@inheritdoc}:  Documentation inheritance

## [](#s-method "Permalink to this headline")Method
- In a class, if you are overriding or implementing a method from a base class or interface, and the documentation should be exactly the same as the base class/interface method, use the following docblock syntax:
- {@inheritdoc}
- public function getValue() {
- return $this->value;

## [](#s-property "Permalink to this headline") Property
- Same way as the method, the overriding property's documentation can be inherited as well:
- {@inheritdoc}
- public static $modules = ['block'];`
- Note the {} around the @inheritdoc tag. This must be the only line in the docblock.

## [](#link "Permalink to this headline")@link: HTML links
- The `@link ... @endlink` tag is used to make HTML links in docblock text.
- Syntax example:
- `* See also @link topic_foo Foo topic, @endlink and the
- @link http://example.com web page explaining it further. @endlink`
- Syntax notes:
- `@link` is followed by a space; followed by the name of a function, name of a class, file name, [group identifier](#defgroup), or URL; followed by a space; followed by the link text; followed by `@endlink`. The entire `@link ... @endlink` must be on the same line, and must be preceded and followed by whitespace or newlines. It is not necessary to use `@link ... @endlink` to make a link to a function, class, or file if the link text would be the same as the function name, class name, or file name (those will turn into links in text without using `@link ... @endlink`.
- Drupal standards: The `@link ... @endlink` line is allowed to exceed 80 characters. If it will fit on the preceding or following line along with additional text in the same paragraph that precedes or follows it without exceeding 80 characters, it can be placed on a line with other text. However, if putting it with other text would make the line exceed 80 characters, place it on its own line.

## [](#mainpage "Permalink to this headline")@mainpage: Main documentation for a branch
- The `@mainpage` tag is used to define the main documentation page for a "branch" (a set of code, such as all the code for Drupal 7.x, or all the code for the "foo" module) in the API module. This tag must appear in its own docblock. If a branch contains a file with a mainpage docblock, this documentation is used as the landing page for the branch in the API module. If there is no mainpage docblock, the API module constructs a default landing page.
- Syntax example:
- Welcome to the Drupal 6 developer's documentation. (further text here)

## [](#param "Permalink to this headline")@param: Function parameters
- The `@param` tag is used to document a parameter within a function docblock.
- Syntax examples:
- `* @param string $mail
- The email address. The description can be longer if necessary, and if so,
- you can wrap it to another line.
- @param string $from
- (optional) The email address to send the mail from, if different from
- the site-wide address.`
- Syntax notes:
- The `@param` tag is followed by an optional [data type indicator](#types), then the variable name of the parameter, and then a newline. The following paragraph is considered by the API module to be documentation. The API module formats the information on the same line as the `@param` using a `strong` HTML tag.
- Drupal standards: The documentation is indented two spaces (see example). Data types are required to be included as of Drupal 8.x. Optional parameters are indicated by (optional); include information about the default value only if it is not obvious from the function signature.

## [](#Plugin "Permalink to this headline")@Annotation, @Plugin, etc.: Plugin discovery annotations
- `@Annotation` goes at the very end of a class documentation block to indicate to Doctrine that the class is a Plugin Annotation Type class. The API module displays these classes as if they had `@ingroup annotation` in their documentation blocks (you do not need to add the `@ingroup` if you have `@Annotation` in the documentation block).
- To annotate a plugin class of a particular type, add a section at the very end of the class documentation block similar to this:
- (rest of the documentation for this class)
- id = "aggregator",
- title = @Translation("Default fetcher"),
- description = @Translation("Downloads data from a URL using Drupal's HTTP request handler."),
- class DefaultFetcher implements FetcherInterface {`
- Drupal standards notes:
- It is better to use a specific plugin type, like @EntityType, rather than the generic @Plugin
- Each key of a plugin annotation should be on its own line.
- Annotations are functional code, so individual lines should not be wrapped.
- Same as for [arrays](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/php/php-coding-standards#array), you MUST include a comma after the last element in the definition (and in the definitions of any nested annotations).
- For more information on how annotations are used for plugins, see the [plugin documentation](http://drupal.org/node/1637614).

## [](#ref "Permalink to this headline")@ref: References to sections
- Note: These tags are available in API module versions 7.x-1.1 and later.
- The `@ref` tag is used to make in-page links to sections and sub-sections defined with the [`@section/@subsection`](#section) tags.
- Syntax example:
- `* This is a link to @ref sec_one right here in the text.
- @section sec_one Section 1
- One or more paragraphs for section 1 go here.`
- Syntax note: To make an in-page link to a section or sub-section, insert the `@ref` tag in the text, followed by one space (NOT a newline), followed by the section or sub-section identifier. The link text will be the title defined when you declare the section or sub-section ("Section 1" in this example).

## [](#return "Permalink to this headline")@return: Function return values
- The `@return` tag is used to document the return value within a function docblock.
- Syntax example:
- `* @return string
- The email address. The description can be longer if necessary, and if so,
- you can wrap it to another line.`
- Syntax notes:
- The `@return` tag is followed by an optional [data type indicator](#types), and then a newline. The following paragraph is considered by the API module to be documentation.
- Drupal standards: The documentation is indented two spaces (see example). Data types are required to be included as of Drupal 8.x. Functions without return values must not have @return documentation.

## [](#section "Permalink to this headline")@section, @subsection: Documentation sections
- Note: These tags are available in API module versions 7.x-1.1 and later.
- The `@section` tag is used to make section headings within a docblock, and the `@subsection` tag is used to make sub-sections. The API module renders sections as `h3` HTML tags, and sub-sections as `h4` tags. You can also use the [@ref tag to make in-page links to sections and sub-sections](#ref).
- Syntax example:
- `* @section sec_one Section 1
- One or more paragraphs for section 1 go here.
- @subsection sub_a Sub-section A
- One or more paragraphs for sub-section A go here.`
- Syntax notes:
- Each `@section` and `@sub-section` declaration must be on its own line.
- A declaration consists of the `@section/@subsection` tag, followed by one space, then an identifier (letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens only), then one space, and then the section/sub-section title.

## [](#see "Permalink to this headline")@see: See Also references
- The `@see` tag is used in a docblock to indicate a "See Also" reference. The API module collects these and formats them into a single See Also section on the documentation page.
- Syntax example:
- `* @see foo_bar()
- @see ajax.inc
- @see \My\Namespace\MyModuleClass
- @see \My\Namespace\MyClass::myMethod()
- @see groupname
- @see http://drupal.org/node/1354`
- Syntax notes:
- Follow the `@see` tag by a space, and then the item or URL you want to reference. An item can be a function name, class name, method name (with the class), constant name, file name, [group identifier](#defgroup), or a URL. The API module will format each item it recognizes as a link, and all of the text it finds between `@see` and the next documentation tag or blank line in its own paragraph.
- Drupal standards: Each `@see` reference is on its own line, with no additional text beyond the item being referenced. To provide more explanation, just use a regular documentation paragraph.

## [](#throws "Permalink to this headline")@throws: Thrown exceptions
- The `@throws` tag is used to document that a function or method throws an exception, and if a function/method has this tag, the API module will create a section listing the exceptions thrown on the function/method page.
- Syntax example:
- `(docblock)
- @throws \My\Namespace\MyFooUndefinedException
- Optional description paragraph here, indented by 2 spaces as usual.
- (rest of docblock)`
- Drupal standards notes: The name of an exception class should appear on the same line as the `@throws` tag. Put explanations in starting on the next line, but only if they tell you something useful that is not conveyed by the name of the class. If you include an explanation, like other documentation use complete sentences that stand alone, without assuming that "Throws \[exception name\]" is part of the sentence automatically, since Throws will be a heading when it's displayed on api.drupal.org.

## [](#todo "Permalink to this headline")@todo: To Do notes
- The `@todo` tag is used to place To Do notes in documentation. At this time, the API module does not do anything special with these notes, so they are simply displayed as paragraphs of text with the `@todo` tag left in.
- Usually, a corresponding Drupal.org issue should be created for the @todo and referenced in it.
- Syntax example:
- `* @todo Remove this in D8. http://www.drupal.org/node/1234567
- @todo Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam
- nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed
- diam voluptua.`

## [](#var "Permalink to this headline")@var: Class property data types
- The `@var` tag is used to document the data type of a class property.
- Syntax example:
- > `class FooBar {
- >    * The entity type manager.
- >    * @var \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface
- >   protected $entityTypeManager;
- > Syntax notes: The @var tag is followed by a space and then a [data type specification](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/php/api-documentation-and-comment-standards#types).
- > `class FooBar {
- >   use \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface;
- >    * The entity type manager.
- >   protected EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager;
- > Typed class properties may omit the @var declaration. It is recommended to use typed properties whenever possible.
