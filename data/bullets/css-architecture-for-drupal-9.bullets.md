- CSS should be predictable, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Components are the discrete, purpose-built visual elements that make up the UI of a site or app.
- Avoid modifying components based on context as it makes CSS less predictable and maintainable.
- Don't rely on HTML structure in CSS selectors. Keep selectors short and use classes to assign appearance to markup.
- Avoid overly generic class names and define component elements explicitly, prefixing them with the component’s name followed by two underscores.
- Extend components using modifier classes. Both base and modifier classes must appear together in the markup.
- Separate concerns in components. Components should not be responsible for their positioning or layout within the site.
- Use dedicated classes for JavaScript manipulation rather than relying on classes already in use for CSS.
- Avoid applying inline styles using JavaScript. Apply a class name describing the state and allow CSS to provide the appearance.
- Name components using design semantics. Class names used as CSS hooks should reflect design semantics over content semantics.
- Class names should use full words rather than abbreviations and always use a dash between words.
- Avoid using the id selector in CSS due to its increased selector specificity.
- Use `!important` sparingly and appropriately, and in general should be restricted to themes. Never use `!important` to resolve specificity problems for general CSS rules.
- Drupal uses the SMACSS system to conceptually categorize CSS rules. The categories are: Base, Layout, Component, State, and Theme.
- Base rules consist of styling for HTML elements only and should never include class selectors.
- Layout rules deal with the arrangement of elements on the page, including grid systems.
- Component rules deal with reusable, discrete UI elements.
- State rules deal with transient changes to a component’s appearance.
- Theme rules deal with purely visual styling, such as border, box-shadow, colors and backgrounds, font properties, etc.
