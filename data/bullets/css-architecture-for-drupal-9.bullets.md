- CSS should be predictable, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Components, which consist of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript, should be discrete, purpose-built visual elements.
- Avoid modifying components based on context as it makes CSS less predictable and maintainable.
- Do not rely on HTML structure in CSS selectors as it makes styles easy to break and hard to reuse.
- Avoid overly generic class names and making a rule do too much.
- Avoid creating style rules that undo other rules.
- Avoid reliance on HTML structure in CSS. Use classes to assign appearance to markup and keep selectors short.
- Define component elements (sub-objects) using their own classes, prefixing them with the component’s name followed by two underscores.
- Extend components using modifier classes. Both base and modifier classes must appear together in the markup.
- Separate concerns. Components should not be responsible for their positioning or layout within the site. Separate structural rules from stylistic rules.
- Use dedicated classes for JavaScript manipulation rather than relying on classes already in use for CSS.
- Avoid applying inline styles using JavaScript.
- Name components using design semantics. Class names used as CSS hooks should reflect design semantics over content semantics.
- Class names should use full words rather than abbreviations and should always use a dash between words.
- Avoid using the id selector in CSS. Use it for JavaScript hooks, anchors within the document for links, and for associating labels with form elements or for associating DOM elements using ARIA attributes.
- Use `!important` sparingly and appropriately, and in general should be restricted to themes. Avoid using `!important` to resolve specificity problems for general CSS rules.
- Drupal core and contrib modules should avoid the `!important` flag, since all module CSS should be easy to override.
