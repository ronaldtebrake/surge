- CSS should be predictable, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Components are the discrete, purpose-built visual elements that make up the UI of a site or app.
- Avoid modifying components based on context as it makes CSS less predictable and maintainable.
- Avoid relying on HTML structure in CSS selectors as it makes the resulting styles easy to break and hard to reuse.
- Avoid overly generic class names as they can unintentionally affect other elements.
- Avoid making a rule do too much by applying positioning, margins, padding, colors, borders and text styles all in a single rule.
- Avoid creating style rules that undo other rules, as it makes CSS over-complex, hard to understand and maintain, and bloats the stylesheet.
- CSS should define the appearance of an element anywhere and everywhere it appears.
- Use classes to assign appearance to markup and never use id selectors in CSS.
- Keep selectors short. The best selector is a single class or element.
- Define component elements (sub-objects) using their own classes, prefixing them with the component’s name followed by two underscores.
- Extend components using modifier classes. Both base and modifier classes must appear together in the markup.
- Separate concerns within components, separating structural rules from stylistic rules.
- Use dedicated classes for JavaScript manipulation rather than relying on classes already in use for CSS.
- Avoid applying inline styles using JavaScript.
- Name components using design semantics, reflecting the intent and purpose of the design element they represent.
- Class names should use full words rather than abbreviations and should always use a dash between words.
- Avoid using the id selector in CSS and use the 'id' attribute for JavaScript hooks, document anchors, and associating labels with form elements.
- Use the `!important` flag sparingly and appropriately, and in general, restrict its use to themes.
