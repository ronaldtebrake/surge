- CSS should be predictable, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Components are discrete, purpose-built visual elements that make up the UI of a site or app.
- Avoid modifying components based on context as it makes CSS less predictable and maintainable.
- Do not rely on HTML structure in CSS selectors as it makes the resulting styles easy to break and hard to reuse.
- Avoid overly generic class names and making a rule do too much.
- Avoid creating style rules that undo other rules.
- CSS should define the appearance of an element anywhere it appears.
- Use classes to assign appearance to markup and never use id selectors in CSS.
- Keep selectors short, ideally a single class or element.
- Define component elements explicitly, prefixing them with the component’s name followed by two underscores.
- Extend components using modifier classes.
- Separate structural rules from stylistic rules within components.
- Use dedicated classes for JavaScript manipulation rather than relying on classes already in use for CSS.
- Avoid applying inline styles using JavaScript.
- Class names used as CSS hooks should reflect design semantics over content semantics.
- Class names should use full words rather than abbreviations and always use a dash between words.
- Avoid using the id selector in CSS.
- Use `!important` sparingly and appropriately, and in general should be restricted to themes.
- Never use `!important` to resolve specificity problems for general CSS rules.
