- Group rulesets into logical files to enforce separation of concerns within the CSS.
- Follow a SMACSS-style categorization of CSS rules: Base, Layout, Component, State (rarely used), and Theme (rarely used).
- Place all of a module's styles in a `css/` sub-directory and divide into the following files: `module_name.module.css`, `module_name.theme.css`, `module_name.admin.css`, and `module_name.admin.theme.css`.
- If a module attaches a CSS file to a template file, the CSS file should be named the same as the template file.
- For Drupal themes, always separate Base, Layout, and Component styles into their own files.
- For complex themes, consider placing each component or component family in its own file.
- State rules, including media queries, should be included with the component to which they apply.
- Theme rules may or may not have their own file(s). If not, include theme rules with their corresponding component.
- Module styles are always loaded before theme styles and the SMACSS groups cannot be interlaced between modules and themes.
- In Drupal 8 and later, themes now have the ability to override stylesheets without affecting the “every page” option of the original stylesheet.
- There should never be conditionally-loaded base styles.
- The order of styles within an aggregate are determined by the “weight” option of `drupal_add_css()`.
- Use SMACSS with Sass/Compass to gain more control over output CSS. Use Sass Globbing to have multiple .scss files and only one CSS file with the use of partials.
