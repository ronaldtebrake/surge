- Group rulesets into logical files to enforce separation of concerns within the CSS.
- Follow a SMACSS-style categorization of CSS rules: Base, Layout, Component, State, and Theme.
- Base should include HTML element styling, typography, root scooped CSS custom properties, resets, and utility classes.
- Layout should include overall layout of the page including page template layout, region layout, etc.
- Component should contain the majority of a theme’s styles and should be scoped to their own CSS files.
- State and Theme categories are not frequently used with modern CSS.
- All of a module's styles should be placed in a `css/` sub-directory and broken into one or more of the following files: `module_name.module.css`, `module_name.theme.css`, `module_name.admin.css`, `module_name.admin.theme.css`.
- Modules should never have any base styles. Instead, use the Normalize.css library augmented with a drupal.base.css library.
- If a module attaches a CSS file to a template file, the CSS file should be named the same as the template file.
- For Drupal themes, always separate Base, Layout, and Component styles into their own files.
- For complex themes, consider placing each component or component family in its own file.
- State rules, including media queries, should be included with the component to which they apply.
- Theme rules may or may not have their own file(s). If not, include theme rules with their corresponding component.
- In Drupal 8 and later, themes now have the ability to override stylesheets without affecting the “every page” option of the original stylesheet.
- There should never be conditionally-loaded base styles.
- The order of styles within an aggregate are determined by the “weight” option of `drupal_add_css()`.
- Use SMACSS when combined with Sass/Compass concept to have control over output CSS. Use Sass Globbing concept to have multiple .scss files and only one CSS file with the use of partials.
