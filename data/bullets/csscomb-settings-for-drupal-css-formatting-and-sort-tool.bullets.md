- Utilize CSScomb tool for formatting and sorting CSS properties in css, scss, sass, or less files.
- CSScomb can be used as a command-line tool, a plugin for Sublime Text, Atom, Grunt, Gulp, PhpStorm, or Vim.
- Follow the recommendations in the CSS formatting guidelines for setting values in CSScomb.
- The sort order of CSS properties should be based on the Yandex configuration file and improved for SASS/LESS by putting variables first.
- Copy the configuration into the CSScomb package settings file under Preferences in Sublime Text after installation of the plugin.
- For other use cases, put the configuration in a file named `.csscomb.json` in your local home folder to make it applicable to all your projects.
- Use csscombx, a fork of Csscomb, specifically intended for Drupal. It has a default configuration file with the same content.
- Install nodejs on your system to use npm, a package manager for many popular javascript projects.
- Install csscombx globally.
- After installing, navigate to your theme's root folder (or any folder containing style files to be formatted) and make a dry run without changing anything.
- Use `-v` option for verbose and `-l` for lint. It scans the current directory recursively for all css, scss, sass, and less files and reports their status relative to the settings in the drupal.json configuration file of the tool.
- Customize default settings by copying the content of the file and paste into `.csscombx.json` file in the root of your theme, a particular style folder, webroot folder or any other folder where you require your customized formatting settings to be applied.
- Automate the formatting task and run it whenever the style file(s) are saved after being edited using the gulp-csscombx plugin.
- Install gulp-cli globally.
- Create package.json file in the root of your theme, module or any other project.
- Create a gulpfile.js file in the root of your theme, module or any other project.
- Adjust `mySrcStyles` variable's value for the content you want to be formatted.
- If default configuration file's settings do not comply with Drupal CSS coding standards, create a new issue for the CSS component of the Drupal core, post a comment on the page to notify all the participants involved, or create the issue or make a pull request on the csscombx.
