- Utilize CSScomb for formatting and sorting CSS properties in css, scss, sass, or less files.
- CSScomb can be used as a command-line tool, a plugin for Sublime Text, Atom, Grunt, Gulp, an external tool for PhpStorm, or a plugin for Vim.
- Adhere to the recommendations in the CSS formatting guidelines when using CSScomb.
- The sort order of CSS properties should be based on the Yandex configuration file and improved for SASS/LESS by putting variables first.
- The CSScomb configuration should be placed in the CSScomb package settings file under Preferences in Sublime Text or in a .csscomb.json file in your local home folder to apply it to all projects.
- Consider using csscombx, a fork of CSScomb specifically intended for Drupal. It has a default configuration file with the same content as CSScomb.
- Install nodejs on your system to use csscombx.
- Install csscombx globally and use it in your theme's root folder or any folder containing style files to be formatted.
- Use the -v option for verbose and -l for lint when using csscombx.
- Customize formatting settings by copying the content of the drupal.json configuration file and pasting it into a .csscombx.json file in the root of your theme, a particular style folder, webroot folder, or any other folder where you require your customized formatting settings to be applied.
- Automate the formatting task by using the gulp-csscombx plugin.
- Install gulp-cli globally to use gulp-csscombx.
- Create a package.json file in the root of your theme, module, or any other project and run the appropriate command to use gulp-csscombx.
- Create a gulpfile.js file in the root of your theme, module, or any other project, adjust the mySrcStyles variable's value for the content you want to be formatted, and run the appropriate command to use gulp-csscombx.
- If you believe that some of the drupal.json default configuration file's settings do not comply with Drupal CSS coding standards, create a new issue for the CSS component of the Drupal core, post a comment on the relevant page, or create the issue or make a pull request on the csscombx repository.
