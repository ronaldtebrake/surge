- Use CSScomb to format and sort CSS properties in css, scss, sass or less files.
- Ensure the values used in CSScomb are in accordance with the CSS formatting guidelines.
- The sort order of CSS properties should be based on the Yandex configuration file and improved for SASS/LESS by putting variables first.
- Copy the configuration into the CSScomb package settings file under Preferences in Sublime Text or in a file named `.csscomb.json` in your local home folder to apply it to all your projects.
- Use csscombx, a fork of CSScomb, specifically intended for Drupal, as an alternative.
- Install csscombx globally using npm, the package manager for many popular javascript projects.
- Make a dry run without changing anything to scan the current directory recursively for all css, scss, sass and less files and report their status relative to the settings in the drupal.json configuration file of the tool.
- Customize formatting settings by copying the content of the drupal.json file and pasting it into a .csscombx.json file in the root of your theme, a particular style folder, webroot folder or any other folder.
- Automate the formatting task and run it whenever the style file(s) are saved after being edited using the gulp-csscombx plugin.
- Install gulp-cli globally and create a package.json file in the root of your theme, module or any other project.
- Adjust the mySrcStyles variable's value for the content you want to be formatted and run the gulp watcher's task.
- Terminate the gulp watcher's task by pressing Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut when you are done with developing your styles.
- If the drupal.json default configuration file's settings do not comply with Drupal CSS coding standards, create a new issue for the CSS component of the Drupal core or make a pull request on the csscombx.
