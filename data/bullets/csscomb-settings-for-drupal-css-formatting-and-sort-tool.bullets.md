- Use CSScomb to format and sort CSS properties in css, scss, sass or less files.
- CSScomb should be used in accordance with the recommendations in the CSS formatting guidelines.
- The sort order of CSS properties should be based on the Yandex configuration file and improved for SASS/LESS by putting variables first.
- The CSScomb configuration should be copied into the CSScomb package settings file under Preferences in Sublime Text or in a file named `.csscomb.json` in your local home folder to make it applicable to all your projects.
- To have ruleset groups divided by an empty line, replace the empty lines in the configuration.
- As an alternative, use csscombx, a fork of Csscomb tool specifically intended for Drupal.
- Install csscombx globally and use it in your theme's root folder or any folder containing style files to be formatted.
- Use the `-v` option for verbose and `-l` for lint to scan the current directory recursively for all css, scss, sass and less files and report their status relative to the settings in the drupal.json configuration file of the tool.
- Customize formatting settings by copying the content of the drupal.json file and pasting into `.csscombx.json` file in the root of your theme, a particular style folder, webroot folder or any other folder where you require your customized formatting settings to be applied.
- Automate the formatting task by using the gulp-csscombx plugin.
- Install gulp-cli globally and create a `package.json` file in the root of your theme, module or any other project.
- Create a `gulpfile.js` file in the root of your theme, module or any other project and adjust `mySrcStyles` variable's value for the content you want to be formatted.
- Run the gulp watcher's task whenever the style file(s) are saved after being edited and terminate it when you are done with developing your styles.
- If the drupal.json default configuration file's settings do not comply with Drupal CSS coding standards, create a new issue for the CSS component of the Drupal core.
