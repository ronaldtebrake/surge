- All JavaScript items such as methods, object constructors and properties, functions, variables, etc. need to have documentation headers.
- Behaviors should be specifically documented.
- Not all of the @tags used for PHP are supported in JavaScript.
- To indicate the data type for a `@param` or `@return` tag, put the data type in `{}` brackets: `@param {TheType} paramName` or `@return {TheType}`.
- Use `number`, `string`, `bool`, `null`, `undefined`, `object`, `function`, `Array` for non-object data types.
- For particular objects, use the constructor name; this could be a built-in JavaScript class (`Date`, `RegExp`), a DOM element (`HTMLElement`, `HTMLInputElement`), a Drupal-specific class (`Drupal.Ajax`), etc.
- Use `@fires` to document events that are triggered by a JavaScript function.
- If the event is a custom event, add a documentation block immediately before the first line of code within a function that triggers the event, with an `@event` tag, to document the event itself. Only include one `@event` block for each custom event.
- When documenting an object that is not being used as a namespace or class, use `@prop {type} name` tags to document its properties.
- Use `@name` to tell JSDoc the name of what is being documented, if it is not the same as the name in the code.
- Use `@constructor` to indicate that a function is intended to be a class constructor.
- Use `@namespace` to indicate that an object is intended as a namespace.
- JSDoc will assume anything declared as a function is a regular function or method, unless one of the tags above overrides this determination.
