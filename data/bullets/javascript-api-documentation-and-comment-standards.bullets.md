- All JavaScript items including methods, object constructors and properties, functions, variables, etc., must have documentation headers for recognition by the parser.
- Behaviors should be specifically documented.
- Not all @tags used for PHP are supported in JavaScript. Ensure to use only the supported tags.
- Use `{}` brackets to indicate the data type for a `@param` or `@return` tag, e.g., `@param {TheType} paramName` or `@return {TheType}`.
- For non-object data, use `number`, `string`, `bool`, `null`, `undefined`, `object`, `function`, `Array`.
- For specific objects, use the constructor name. This could be a built-in JavaScript class (`Date`, `RegExp`), a DOM element (`HTMLElement`, `HTMLInputElement`), a Drupal-specific class (`Drupal.Ajax`), etc.
- Use `@fires` to document events that are triggered by a JavaScript function. If the event is a custom event, add a documentation block immediately before the first line of code within a function that triggers the event, with an `@event` tag.
- Use `@prop {type} name` tags to document properties of an object that is not being used as a namespace or class.
- Use `@name` to tell JSDoc the name of what is being documented, if it is not the same as the name in the code.
- Use `@constructor` to indicate that a function is intended to be a class constructor.
- Use `@namespace` to indicate that an object is intended as a namespace.
- In most cases, there's no need to use `@function` - JSDoc will assume anything declared as a function is a regular function or method, unless one of the tags above overrides this determination.
- Follow the specified order of declaration for available tags.
