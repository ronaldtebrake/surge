- JavaScript code should not be embedded in the HTML where possible to avoid adding significantly to page weight.
- Use literal expressions instead of the `new` operator: Use `[]` instead of `new Array()` and `{}` instead of `new Object()`.
- It is recommended to use literal expressions instead of the wrapper forms `new Number`, `new String`, `new Boolean` in situations where the literal expression is the same.
- The `with` statement must not be used, as it is not possible to use `with` with enabled strict mode. Use the explicit longer version instead.
- To prevent unreachable code, a `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw` statement should be followed by a `}` or `case` or `default`.
- `eval()` should not be used due to its high resource consumption and potential for misuse. Also, avoid using the `Function` constructor and passing strings to `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.
- All output to the browser that has been provided by a user should be escaped through `Drupal.checkPlain()` first to prevent XSS.
- When adding new HTML elements to the DOM, do not use `document.createElement()`. Use the jQuery equivalent for cross-browser compatibility and file size reduction.
- Any modules containing JavaScript which produces HTML content must provide default theme functions in the Drupal.theme.prototype namespace.
- All strings in JavaScript files should be wrapped in `Drupal.t()`, and use `Drupal.formatPlural()` for equivalent to `format_plural()`.
