- JavaScript code should not be embedded in the HTML to avoid adding to page weight.
- Use literal expressions instead of the `new` operator. For example, use `[]` instead of `new Array()` and `{}` instead of `new Object()`.
- The `with` statement must not be used, as it is incompatible with enabled strict mode.
- To prevent unreachable code, a `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw` statement should be followed by a `}` or `case` or `default`.
- `eval()` should not be used due to its inefficiency and potential for misuse.
- Do not use the `Function` constructor, and do not pass strings to `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.
- All output to the browser that has been provided by a user should be escaped through `Drupal.checkPlain()`.
- When adding new HTML elements to the DOM, do not use `document.createElement()`. Use the jQuery equivalent for cross-browser compatibility and to reduce file size.
- Any modules containing JavaScript which produces HTML content must provide default theme functions in the Drupal.theme.prototype namespace.
- All strings in JavaScript files should be wrapped in `Drupal.t()`, which is an equivalent of the `t()` function.
- Use `Drupal.formatPlural()`, an equivalent to `format_plural()`, when necessary. The parameter order is the same as their server-side counterparts.
