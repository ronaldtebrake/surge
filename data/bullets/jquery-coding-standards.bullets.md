- Prefix variables that point to jQuery objects with a dollar sign ($). This makes it clear which variables are jQuery objects.
- Stay updated with jQuery syntax best-practices to avoid compatibility issues with newer versions of jQuery.
- Utilize chaining selectors either by using CSS method $(' a b > c') or JavaScript chaining $('a').find('b').children('c'). The second method is slightly faster.
- Reduce the weight of selector whenever possible. If .children() and .find() return the same results, use .find() method.
- Utilize event delegation. Instead of binding an event listener function to all elements, bind it once to their parent.
- Do not simply `return false;` to prevent the default behavior of an event. If you wish to prevent the default behavior or stop propagation, they should be explicitly defined.
- Separate code into individual functions and call them when needed.
- Always give your selectors a context. If the context is a cached selection, use find().
- Finding elements by the tag ID is faster than by class name. If your target element appears only once, select it by #id. If there are more than one, use class but descend from an #id.
- Use booleans to set a property, not an empty string in jQuery.attr(). Do not assume that property values that are returned are always booleans. `.attr('checked')` could return either `true` or `'checked'` depending on jQuery version and markup.
- Use jQuery.each() when dealing with existing instantiated jQuery objects and the need to iterate on them. For simple native JavaScript arrays or objects, use native JavaScript `for` loops which are faster.
