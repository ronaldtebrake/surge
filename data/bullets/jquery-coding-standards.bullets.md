- Prefix variables that point to jQuery objects with a dollar sign ($). This helps to easily distinguish which variables are jQuery objects and which are not.
- Avoid compatibility issues by keeping up to date with jQuery syntax best-practices. This helps to prevent conflicts with updated versions of jQuery.
- Use chaining selectors either by CSS method $(' a b > c') or JavaScript chaining $('a').find('b').children('c'). The second method is slightly faster. Reduce the weight of selector if possible. Use .find() method if .children() and .find() will return the same results.
- Utilize event delegation. Instead of binding an event listener function to all elements, bind it once to their parent. Avoid using `return false;` to prevent the default behavior of that event as it also prevents the "bubbling" propagation of the event.
- Separate functions into individual functions and call them when needed.
- Provide selectors with a context. The default context will search the entire page's DOM. If the context is a cached selection, use find().
- Use #id for selecting elements that appear only once on the page as it is faster than selecting by class name. If there are more than one, use class but descend from an #id.
- Use booleans to set a property in jQuery.attr(), not an empty string. Do not assume that property values that are returned are always booleans. This applies only for D6 and D7.
- Use native JavaScript `for` loops when needing to iterate over simple native JavaScript arrays or objects as they are significantly faster than jQuery.each(). This method should be used when dealing with existing instantiated jQuery objects and the need to iterate on them.
