- Prefix variables that point to jQuery objects with a dollar sign ($). This helps to easily distinguish which variables are jQuery objects.
- Avoid compatibility issues by keeping up to date with jQuery syntax best-practices. This helps to prevent conflicts with updated versions of jQuery.
- Use CSS method or JavaScript chaining for chaining selectors. Reduce the weight of selector if possible. Use .find() method if .children() and .find() return the same results.
- Use event delegation to bind an event listener function to parent elements instead of binding it to all elements individually. 
- Do not misuse 'return false;' to prevent the default behavior of an event as it also prevents the "bubbling" propagation of the event. If you wish to either prevent the default behavior or stop propagation, they should be explicitly defined.
- Separate your functions into individual functions and call them when needed.
- Always provide a context to your selectors. If the context is a cached selection, use find().
- Use #id for selecting elements that appear on the page only once as it is faster than selecting by class name. If there are more than one target elements, use class but descend from an #id.
- For D6 and D7 versions, use booleans to set a property in jQuery.attr(), not an empty string. Do not assume that property values that are returned are always booleans.
- Use native JavaScript 'for' loops for iterating over simple native JavaScript arrays or objects instead of jQuery.each() as it is significantly faster.
