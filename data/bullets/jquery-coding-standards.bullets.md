- Prefix variables that point to jQuery objects with a dollar sign ($). This helps distinguish which variables are jQuery objects.
- Avoid compatibility issues by keeping up to date with syntax best practices. This helps prevent conflicts with updated versions of jQuery.
- Use chaining selectors either with the CSS method $(' a b > c') or JavaScript chaining $('a').find('b').children('c'). The second method is slightly faster.
- Reduce the weight of selector where possible. If .children() and .find() will return the same results, use .find() method.
- Use event delegation wisely. Instead of binding an event listener function to all elements, bind it once to their parent.
- Do not misuse `return false;` to prevent the default behavior of an event. It also prevents the "bubbling" propagation of the event. If you wish to prevent the default behavior or stop propagation, they should be explicitly defined.
- Separate your functions into individual functions and call them when needed.
- Always try to give your selectors a context. The default context will search the entire page's DOM. If the context is a cached selection, use find().
- Finding elements by the tag ID is faster than by class name. If your target element appears on the page only once, select it by #id. If you have more than one, use class but descend from an #id.
- For D6 and D7, use booleans to set a property, not an empty string in jQuery.attr(). Do not assume that property values that are returned are always booleans.
- Use jQuery.each() when dealing with existing instantiated jQuery objects and the need to iterate on them. For simple native JavaScript arrays or objects, use native JavaScript `for` loops which are faster than jQuery.each().
