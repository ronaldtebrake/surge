- Implement the PSR-4 standard for package-based PHP namespace autoloading in Drupal 8.
- Ensure autoloading works for both modules and themes.
- Each module should have a namespace that corresponds to its module name.
- The module's namespace should be mapped to the `./src/` folder in the module directory.
- Anything after the module namespace should directly map to the directory and file structure in the `./src/` folder.
- Apply the same logic to PHPUnit tests contained in `./tests/src/`.
- The `modules/vegetable/src/Tests` folder should contain the SimpleTest test code and the `modules/vegetable/tests` folder should contain the PHPUnit test code.
- Use SimpleTest and PHPUnit as testing frameworks, with PHPUnit being the recommended one.
- The namespace of all Drupal core components, as well as contributed modules, should begin with `Drupal\`.
- The first parts of a namespaced class name should indicate the base namespace that maps to a registered base directory.
- For modules, `$modulename` should be the unique machine name of the module, consisting of lowercase characters and underscores.
- The remaining part of a namespaced class name should indicate the relative path within the base directory: each PHP namespace separator (`\`) should be replaced with a directory separator (`/`) and the `.php` extension should be appended.
- Each PHP class, interface, or trait should live in a separate PHP file.
