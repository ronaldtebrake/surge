- Drupal 8 implements the PSR-4 standard for package-based PHP namespace autoloading.
- Upgrading Drupal 7 modules to Drupal 8 requires using PSR-4 standards.
- Autoloading works for both modules and themes.
- Each module has a namespace that corresponds to its module name.
- The module's namespace is mapped to the `./src/` folder in the module directory.
- Anything after the module namespace directly maps to the directory and file structure in the `./src/` folder.
- The identical logic applies to PHPUnit tests contained in `./tests/src/`.
- The namespace of all Drupal core components, as well as contributed modules, begins with `Drupal\`.
- The first parts of a namespaced class name indicate the base namespace that maps to a registered base directory, in which PHP files will be looked up.
- For modules, `$modulename` is the unique machine name of the module, which consists of lowercase characters and underscores.
- The remaining part of a namespaced class name indicates the relative path within the base directory: each PHP namespace separator (`\`) is replaced with a directory separator (`/`) and the `.php` extension is appended.
- Each PHP class, interface, or trait lives in a separate PHP file.
- SimpleTest is deprecated in Drupal 8 but is still supported and PHPUnit is the recommended testing framework.
