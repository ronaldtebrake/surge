- Install ESLint and Prettier for analyzing static code, enforcing coding best practices, and formatting code consistently in JavaScript source code for Drupal.
- Use Yarn as the package manager for installing these tools on your project's codebase.
- Ensure a Node.js instance is installed and running on the stack for Yarn, ESLint, and Prettier to function.
- Prepare the environment by building upon the `drupal/core-recommended` meta-package and running in a containerized local development environment with DDEV.
- Enable the Corepack component in DDEV for a package manager to be available out-of-the-box.
- Install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file located in the `web/core/` directory of your Drupal Core.
- Check if ESLint and Prettier are running normally by asking their version number.
- Make the content of `node_modules/` available from other places in the codebase by creating a symlink from the topmost project root pointing to its content.
- Run the linting process to check any JavaScript file in the project codebase using the command `$ ddev yarn eslint {{../relative-path/to-the/file}}`.
- To allow ESLint to modify file content where an automatically fixable coding standard violation is detected, and reformat the style of the entire file, add the "--fix" switch to the command.
- For specific modules that need to change some rules due to the use of a third-party library, create a separate `.eslintrc.json` file in the module directory to turn some rules on or off and add global variables they require.
