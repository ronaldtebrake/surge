- Use ESLint and Prettier for analyzing and formatting JavaScript source code in Drupal projects.
- Install ESLint and Prettier using a package manager, preferably Yarn, as recommended by the Drupal community.
- Ensure a Node.js instance is installed and running on the stack for Yarn, ESLint, and Prettier to function.
- Use DDEV for a containerized local development environment, which comes with the latest version of Node.js installed.
- Enable Corepack in DDEV by setting its value to "true" in the `.ddev/config.yaml` file.
- Update Corepack to its latest version using the command `$ ddev yarn set version stable`.
- Install required packages using the `package.json` file located in the `web/core/` directory of the Drupal Core.
- Ensure the `web/core/node_modules/` directory contains executable files for `eslint` and `prettier`.
- Make the content of `node_modules/` available from other locations by creating a symlink from the project root pointing to its content.
- Run the linting process to check any JavaScript file in the project codebase using the command `$ ddev yarn eslint {{../relative-path/to-the/file}}`.
- Use the "--fix" switch with the ESLint command to automatically fix coding standard violations and reformat the style of the entire file.
- For specific modules using third-party libraries, create a custom `.eslintrc.json` file in the module directory to turn some rules on or off and add required global variables.
