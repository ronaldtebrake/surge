- Install ESLint and Prettier tools on the project's codebase for analyzing static code and enforcing coding best practices.
- Use Yarn as the package manager for installing these tools.
- Ensure a Node.js instance is installed and running on the stack.
- Enable the Corepack component in the DDEV containerization tool for having a package manager available out-of-the-box.
- Use the `package.json` file in the `web/core/` directory of Drupal Core to list all frontend-related external dependencies.
- Install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file using the command `$ ddev yarn install`.
- Ensure the `web/core/node_modules/.bin/` directory contains two executable files: `eslint` and `prettier`.
- Check if ESLint and Prettier run normally by asking their version number.
- Make the content of `node_modules/` available from other places in the codebase by creating a symlink from the topmost project root pointing to its content.
- Run the linting process to check any JavaScript file existing in the project codebase using the syntax `$ ddev yarn eslint {{../relative-path/to-the/file}}`.
- To have ESLint automatically fix coding standard violations and reformat the style of the entire file, add the "--fix" switch to the command.
- For specific modules that need to change some rules, create a `.eslintrc.json` file in the module directory to turn some rules on or off and add global variables they require.
