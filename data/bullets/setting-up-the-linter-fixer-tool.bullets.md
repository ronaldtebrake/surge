- Understand the purpose and nature of Drupal's coding standards for JavaScript.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for analyzing and formatting JavaScript source code for Drupal.
- Install ESLint and Prettier on your project's codebase using a package manager.
- Use Yarn as the recommended package manager for the Drupal community.
- Ensure a Node.js instance is installed and run on the stack.
- Set up the development environment using the `drupal/core-recommended` meta-package and running in a containerized local development environment with DDEV.
- Enable the Corepack component in DDEV for having a package manager available out-of-the-box.
- Install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file located in the `web/core/` directory.
- Ensure the `web/core/node_modules/` directory contains two executable files: `eslint` and `prettier`.
- Make the content of `node_modules/` available from other places by creating a symlink from the topmost project root pointing to its content.
- Run the linting process to check any JavaScript file existing in the project codebase using the syntax `$ ddev yarn eslint {{../relative-path/to-the/file}}`.
- Add the "--fix" switch to the command to allow ESLint to modify file content where an automatically fixable coding standard violation is detected and reformat the style of the entire file.
- Create a custom `.eslintrc.json` for specific modules that need to change some rules or add global variables.
