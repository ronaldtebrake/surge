- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript code analysis and formatting in Drupal projects.
- Install ESLint and Prettier using a package manager, with Yarn being the recommended choice for Drupal community.
- Ensure Node.js is installed and running on the stack for Yarn, ESLint, and Prettier to function.
- Use DDEV for a containerized local development environment, which comes with the latest version of Node.js.
- Enable Corepack in DDEV to have a package manager available out-of-the-box.
- Install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file located in the `web/core/` directory of the Drupal project.
- Ensure `eslint` and `prettier` executables are present in the `web/core/node_modules/.bin/` directory after installation.
- Create a symlink from the project root to `node_modules/` to make its content available from other locations in the codebase.
- Use the command `$ ddev yarn eslint {{../relative-path/to-the/file}}` to run the linting process on any JavaScript file in the project codebase.
- Add the "--fix" switch to the command to allow ESLint to modify file content where an automatically fixable coding standard violation is detected.
- For specific modules that require changes in some rules, create a `.eslintrc.json` in the module directory to turn some rules on or off and add global variables they require.
