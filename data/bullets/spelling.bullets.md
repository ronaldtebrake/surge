- Use US English spelling for all source code, including comments and names in Drupal Core.
- Check core code for spelling automatically using CSpell.
- Use all lower case for CSpell in line documentation settings.
- Use the `cspell:ignore` directive to ignore words in a file. List the words alphabetically with a single space between the words. Use multiple lines to meet the number of characters per line limit.

- For multiple lines, disable CSpell before the lines and enable it after. Ensure `cspell` is written in lower case.
