- Use US English spelling for all source code, including comments and names in Drupal Core.
- Core code should be automatically checked for spelling by CSpell.
- Use all lower case for cspell in line documentation settings, for example, `// cspell:ignore.`
- To ignore words in a file, use the `cspell:ignore` directive. Words should be listed alphabetically with a single space between them. Use multiple lines if necessary to meet the number of characters per line limit.
- If a line is not in English or contains a nonsense string (like a random string in a test), disable CSpell for that line. Ensure `cspell` is in lower case.
- To disable CSpell for multiple lines, use 'disable' before the lines and 'enable' after. Ensure `cspell` is in lower case.
