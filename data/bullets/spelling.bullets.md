- Use US English spelling for all source code, including comments and names in Drupal Core.
- Core code should be automatically checked for spelling by CSpell.
- Use all lower case for cspell in line documentation settings, for example, `// cspell:ignore.`
- To ignore words in a file, use the `cspell:ignore` directive. List the words alphabetically with a single space between the words. Use multiple lines to meet the number of characters per line limit.
- If a line is not in English or contains a nonsense string (for example, a random string in a test), disable CSpell for that line. Ensure `cspell` is written in lower case.
- To disable CSpell for multiple lines, use 'disable' before the lines and 'enable' after. Ensure `cspell` is written in lower case.
