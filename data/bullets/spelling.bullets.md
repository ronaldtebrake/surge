- Use US English spelling for all source code, including comments and names in Drupal Core.
- Core code should be automatically checked for spelling by CSpell.
- Use all lower case for cspell in line documentation settings, for example, `// cspell:ignore.`
- Use the `cspell:ignore` directive to ignore specific words in a file. List the words alphabetically with a single space between the words. Use multiple lines if necessary to meet the number of characters per line limit.
- Disable CSpell for a line if it's not in English or if it's a nonsense string, such as a random string in a test. Note that `cspell` should be in lower case.
- To disable CSpell for multiple lines, use disable before the lines and enable after. Note that `cspell` should be in lower case.
