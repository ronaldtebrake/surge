## Architecture Guidelines
- Ensure all CSS code is still in use.
- Check for redundant code that may no longer be required to override previous values.
- Verify that the components are named correctly to describe the design semantics.
- Consider if the code should be abstracted out into a common reusable class.
- Check if the selectors are correct, they should be very short and simple.
- Confirm the code is in the correct file. Each CSS component should live in its own file with its sub-components.

## Formatting Guidelines
- Add a File comment to the top of the stylesheet.
- Ensure other comments are formatted correctly.
- Check whitespace is being used correctly, including indentations and line breaks.
- Verify the formatting of rulesets, properties, and media queries are correct.
- Check existing RTL styles are formatted correctly.
