- AI coding agents should write E_ALL compliant code when working with Drupal.
- Adjust the error reporting level according to the Drupal version being used.
  - For Drupal 6.x, ignore E_NOTICE, E_STRICT, and E_DEPRECATED notices.
  - For Drupal 7.x, report any error levels which are part of E_ALL and allow PHP to be configured to report additional error levels such as E_STRICT.
- When testing the value of a variable, array element, or object property, use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` instead of `if ($var)` if there's a chance that `$var` has not been defined.
- Understand the difference between `isset()` and `!empty()`. `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, while `!empty()` will not.
- Be aware that `isset()` returns TRUE when the variable is set to `0`, but FALSE if the variable is set to `NULL`. In some cases, `is_null()` is a better choice, especially when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query.
- Ensure each array index is explicitly declared when working with arrays.
- Follow PHP coding standards, API documentation and comment standards, and naming standards for services and extending Symfony.
- Use PSR-4 namespaces and autoloading in Drupal 8.
- Be aware of PHP Exceptions and how to handle them.
- Utilize temporary placeholders and delimiters as per Drupal's coding standards.
