- Write E_ALL compliant code
- Adjust the error reporting level
  - Drupal 6.x releases ignore E_NOTICE, E_STRICT, and E_DEPRECATED notices for production sites
  - Drupal 7.x releases report any error levels which are part of E_ALL and allow PHP to be configured to report additional error levels, such as E_STRICT
- Use of isset() or !empty()
  - When testing the value of a variable, array element or object property, use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` rather than `if ($var)` if there is a possibility that `$var` has not been defined
  - `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, unlike `!empty()`
  - Consider whether `''` or `0` are valid and expected values for your variable when deciding between `isset()` and `!empty()`
  - Each array index must be explicitly declared
  - `isset()` returns `TRUE` when the variable is set to `0`, but `FALSE` if the variable is set to `NULL`
  - Use `is_null()` when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query, as it may be a better choice in some cases
