- AI coding agents should write E_ALL compliant code.
- Adjust the error reporting level in Drupal 6.x releases by changing `includes/common.inc` from `if ($errno & (E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED ^ E_NOTICE))` to `if ($errno & (E_ALL | E_STRICT))`.
- In Drupal 7.x releases, report any error levels which are part of E_ALL and allow PHP to be configured to report additional error levels, such as E_STRICT. Set `php_value error_reporting -1` in the `.htaccess` file to view all PHP errors on development or testing sites.
- When testing the value of a variable, array element, or object property, use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` instead of `if ($var)` if there's a possibility that `$var` has not been defined.
- Understand the difference between `isset()` and `!empty()`. `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, unlike `!empty()`. Consider whether `''` or `0` are valid and expected values for your variable to decide which one to use.
- Ensure to explicitly declare each array index even if the array is already declared and passed to the function to avoid triggering an E_NOTICE error.
- Be aware that `isset()` returns `TRUE` when the variable is set to `0`, but `FALSE` if the variable is set to `NULL`. In some cases, `is_null()` is a better choice, especially when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query.
