- Ensure all code written is E_ALL compliant.
- Adjust the error reporting level as per the requirements of the project.
- For Drupal 6.x releases, ignore E_NOTICE, E_STRICT, and E_DEPRECATED notices for the benefit of production sites.
- To view all PHP errors on development or testing sites, change `includes/common.inc` from `if ($errno & (E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED ^ E_NOTICE))` to `if ($errno & (E_ALL | E_STRICT))`.
- Drupal 7.x releases should report any error levels which are part of E_ALL, and allow PHP to be configured to report additional error levels, such as E_STRICT.
- To view all PHP errors on development or testing sites for Drupal 7.x, set `php_value error_reporting -1` in the `.htaccess` file.
- Use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` rather than `if ($var)` to test the value of a variable, array element or object property, especially if there is a possibility that `$var` has not been defined.
- Understand the difference between `isset()` and `!empty()`. `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, unlike `!empty()`. Choose which one to use based on whether `''` or `0` are valid and expected values for your variable.
- Avoid triggering an E_NOTICE error by ensuring each array index is explicitly declared when testing the value of an array element.
- Be aware that the function `isset()` returns `TRUE` when the variable is set to `0`, but `FALSE` if the variable is set to `NULL`. In some cases, `is_null()` is a better choice, especially when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query.
