- Ensure to write E_ALL compliant code when working with Drupal.
- Adjust the error reporting level according to the Drupal version being used.
- For Drupal 6.x, ignore E_NOTICE, E_STRICT, and E_DEPRECATED notices for production sites. To view all PHP errors on development or testing sites, change `includes/common.inc`.
- For Drupal 7.x, report any error levels which are part of E_ALL, and allow PHP to be configured to report additional error levels, such as E_STRICT. To view all PHP errors on development or testing sites, set `php_value error_reporting -1` in the `.htaccess` file.
- When testing the value of a variable, array element, or object property, use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` rather than `if ($var)` if there's a possibility that `$var` has not been defined.
- Understand the difference between `isset()` and `!empty()`. `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, while `!empty()` will not.
- Avoid triggering an E_NOTICE error by ensuring each array index is explicitly declared when passing an array to a function.
- Use `is_null()` when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query, as `isset()` returns `TRUE` when the variable is set to `0`, but `FALSE` if the variable is set to `NULL`.
