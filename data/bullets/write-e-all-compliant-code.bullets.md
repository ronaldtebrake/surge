- Write E_ALL compliant code
- Adjust the error reporting level
  - Drupal 6.x releases ignore E_NOTICE, E_STRICT, and E_DEPRECATED notices
  - Drupal 7.x releases report any error levels which are part of E_ALL
  - To view all PHP errors on development or testing sites, adjust settings in `includes/common.inc` (for Drupal 6.x) or in the `.htaccess` file (for Drupal 7.x)
- Use of isset() or !empty()
  - To test the value of a variable, array element or object property, use `if (isset($var))` or `if (!empty($var))` rather than `if ($var)` if there is a possibility that `$var` has not been defined
  - `isset()` will return TRUE even if the variable is set to an empty string or zero, unlike `!empty()`
  - Consider whether `''` or `0` are valid and expected values for your variable when deciding between `isset()` and `!empty()`
  - Each array index must be explicitly declared
  - `isset()` returns `TRUE` when the variable is set to `0`, but `FALSE` if the variable is set to `NULL`
  - In some cases, `is_null()` is a better choice, especially when testing the value of a variable returned by an SQL query
