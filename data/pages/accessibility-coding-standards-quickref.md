## Accessibility Coding Standards

### Rules
- The Drupal community strives to be inclusive to everyone, including people with disabilities. To that end, the Drupal community has developed the following accessibility coding standards to help make websites and other digital assets accessible to the widest possible audience.
- Effective user experiences serve our entire community, including website visitors with disabilities. A positive experience can be achieved by focusing on three goals:
- 1.  Creating an inclusive strategy: Consider accessibility needs when architecting the site
- 2.  Incorporating Accessible Coding: Use best practices (as outlined below) to ensure that content can be navigated and read by all
- 3.  Following Normalized Testing: Building accessibility reviews into existing processes (and not as an add-on) will help to ensure code pushed out is accessible.
- Drupal has made every effort to seamlessly build accessibility in Drupal Core.  This process empowers developers and authors to build highly legible content that can be parsed by assistive devices, by:
- Providing **text alternatives (alt text)** for non-text content, such as images, charts and graphs.
- Providing accurate transcripts, captions, and descriptions for video.
