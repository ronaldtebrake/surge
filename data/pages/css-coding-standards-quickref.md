## Css Coding Standards

### Rules
- To minimize friction when contributing to CSS, the front-end developers of the Drupal community have reached consensus about our coding standards for:
- Formatting CSS code.
- CSS architecture, including goals, pitfalls and best practices.
- Grouping rulesets into files.
- Despite our natural range of working styles and coding preferences, we value collaboration and ease of development, so we have attempted to explain our standards clearly in the following documents.
- > "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Idea™. If thousands of people are using your code, then **write your code for maximum clarity**." - Idan Gazit
