## Javascript Coding Standards

### Rules
- All code MUST indent using two (2) space characters,
- All code MUST NOT indent using tab characters,
- All code MUST NOT end with trailing whitespace.
- JavaScript allows optional "semi-colon insertion". Drupal standards do not.
- All statements (except `for, function, if, switch, try, while`) MUST be followed by a semi-colon (`;`),
- Return values MUST start on the same line as the `return` keyword.
- *EXCEPTIONS:**
- Anonymous functions assigned to a variable MUST be followed by a semi-colon.
