Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## Avoid "SELECT * FROM ..."

## Avoid "SELECT \* FROM ..."
- Using `SELECT * FROM {node}` queries in versions prior to Drupal 7 can introduce a potential security issue by causing Drupal's Node Access system to be bypassed. In such cases, private content may be shown to unprivileged users. Therefore, queries that generate lists of nodes should avoid SELECT \* syntax in all cases. Instead use `SELECT nid, ...`.
- It is recommended to avoid SELECT \* queries in general. They are less self-documenting than explicitly listing the fields to be retrieved and also very slightly slower. Generally, SELECT \* should be used in only two cases:
- 1.  The fields in the table being selected from are dynamic and not known definitively at development time. (This is extremely rare and generally bad practice anyway.)
- 2.  The list of fields to select is prohibitively long.
- [development\] Is "SELECT \* FROM ..." ok?](http://lists.drupal.org/pipermail/development/2009-February/thread.html#31953) : discussion on the development list.
- [SELECT \* IS EVIL](//www.parseerror.com/sql/select*isevil.html): one developer's perspective.

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Avoid Select From

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
