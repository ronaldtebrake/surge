Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## CSS coding standards

## CSS coding standards
- To minimize friction when contributing to CSS, the front-end developers of the Drupal community have reached consensus about our coding standards for:
- Formatting CSS code.
- CSS architecture, including goals, pitfalls and best practices.
- Grouping rulesets into files.
- Despite our natural range of working styles and coding preferences, we value collaboration and ease of development, so we have attempted to explain our standards clearly in the following documents.
- > "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Idea™. If thousands of people are using your code, then **write your code for maximum clarity**." - Idan Gazit

## Acknowledgements
- This guide is based upon the works, [*Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS*](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) by Nicolas Gallagher and [*Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS*](http://smacss.com) (SMACSS) by Jonathan Snook with a hat tip to Nicole Sullivan’s ground-breaking [*Object Oriented CSS*](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2009/02/12/css-doesn’t-suck-you’re-just-doing-it-wrong/).

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Css Coding Standards

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
