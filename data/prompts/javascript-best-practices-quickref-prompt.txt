I have a documentation page (the Drupal "Javascript Best Practices" standards page) that describes rules or conventions. I want to convert that page into a clear section in AGENTS.md so that an AI coding agent can read and enforce those conventions.

Please do the following:

Read the source content I will provide.

Extract the key conventions / rules / guidelines (in bullet or list form).

Write a section suitable for AGENTS.md, with a heading like ## Javascript Best Practices, followed by the rules in a concise, machine-friendly form.

Ensure the section is self-contained (i.e. an agent reading only AGENTS.md should understand the rules).

Use consistent formatting across sections (e.g. heading levels, bullet style).

## JavaScript best practices
- Last [updated](/node/2297057/discuss) on
- 16 October 2020
- Note: Changes to Drupal coding standards are proposed and discussed in issues in the [Coding Standards project](/project/coding_standards).
- This page covers DOM and Drupal specific code styles.

## [](#jscodeplacement "Permalink to this headline")JavaScript code placement
- JavaScript code SHOULD NOT be embedded in the HTML where possible, as it adds significantly to page weight with no opportunity for mitigation by caching and compression.
- *Beginner's note aside:** "In Drupal 7, there are four primary methods of adding JavaScript to Drupal." See [Managing JavaScript in Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/node/756722).

## [](#literal "Permalink to this headline")Use literal expressions
- Code SHOULD use literal expressions instead of the `new` operator:
- Use `[]` instead of `new Array()`
- Use `{}` instead of `new Object()`
- It is RECOMMENDED to use literal expressions instead of the wrapper forms `new Number`, `new String`, `new Boolean` in situations where the literal expression is the same. However, you MAY use object instances in which it matters:
- `var literalNum = 0;
- var objectNum = new Number(0);
- if (literalNum) { } // false because 0 is a false value, will not be executed.
- if (objectNum) { }  // true because objectNum exists as an object, will be executed.
- if (objectNum.valueOf()) { } // false because the value of objectNum is 0.`

## [](#with "Permalink to this headline")"with" statement
- The `with` statement MUST NOT be used, since it is not possible to use `with` with enabled strict mode.
- Instead, you SHOULD use the explicit longer version:
- `foo.bar.foobar.abc = true;
- foo.bar.foobar.xyz = true;`
- Alternatively, you MAY use references:
- `var o = foo.bar.foobar;
- o.abc = true;
- o.xyz = true;`

## [](#avoidingunreachablecode "Permalink to this headline")Avoiding unreachable code
- To prevent unreachable code, a `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw` statement SHOULD be followed by a `}` or `case` or `default`.

## [](#eval "Permalink to this headline")`eval()` is evil
- `eval()` SHOULD NOT be used.
- The browser has to create an entirely new scripting environment (just like creating a new web page), import all variables from the current scope, execute the script, collect the result, and export the variables back into the original environment. Additionally, the code cannot be cached for optimization purposes. It is both the most powerful and most misused method in JavaScript.
- Note that JavaScript implicitly uses `eval()` for some other language constructs.
- You SHOULD NOT use the `Function` constructor, and you SHOULD NOT pass strings to `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.

## [](#xss "Permalink to this headline")Preventing XSS
- All output to the browser that has been provided by a user SHOULD be escaped through `Drupal.checkPlain()` first.
- This is similar to Drupal's PHP `check_plain()` and encodes special characters in a plain-text string for display as HTML.

## [](#createElement "Permalink to this headline")Modifying the DOM
- When adding new HTML elements to the DOM, you SHOULD NOT use `document.createElement()`.
- For cross-browser compatibility reasons and also in an effort to reduce file size, you SHOULD use the jQuery equivalent.
- `this.popup = $('<div id="autocomplete"></div>')[0];`
- Avoid this:
- `this.popup = document.createElement('div');
- this.popup.id = 'autocomplete';`

## [](#drupal6 "Permalink to this headline")Drupal 6 (and later) Specific Stuff
- Drupal 6 saw the introduction of JavaScript theming and translation of JavaScript files.

## [](#theming "Permalink to this headline")Theming
- There is a theming mechanism for JavaScript code. Any modules containing JavaScript which produces HTML content MUST provide default theme functions in the Drupal.theme.prototype namespace.

## [](#translation "Permalink to this headline")String Translation
- All strings in JavaScript files SHOULD be wrapped in `Drupal.t()`, which is an equivalent of the well-known [`t()`](http://api.drupal.org/t) function.
- Likewise, there is an equivalent to [`format_plural()`](http://api.drupal.org/format_plural), named `Drupal.formatPlural()`.
- Their parameter order is exactly like their server-side counterparts.

## Requirements:

### Format & Structure:
1. **Use AGENTS.md format** - Create a section suitable for AGENTS.md
2. **Use bullet points** - Keep it scannable and concise
3. **Structure logically** - Group related guidelines together
4. **Use clear headers** - Make it easy to navigate

### Content Focus:
5. **Extract key conventions/rules** - Focus on the most important coding standards and conventions
6. **Be concise** - Avoid lengthy explanations, focus on actionable guidelines
7. **Prioritize AI-relevant content** - Rules that AI coding agents should follow and enforce
8. **Minimize token usage** - Use bullet points only, no examples or lengthy explanations

### AI Optimization:
9. **Make it actionable** - Each point should be something an AI can implement or enforce
10. **Use consistent formatting** - Standardize the format for easy parsing
11. **Focus on conventions** - Coding standards, naming conventions, best practices, rules
12. **Self-contained** - An agent reading only this section should understand the rules

### Output Format:
Generate an AGENTS.md section in this exact format:

## Javascript Best Practices

### Rules
- [Essential rule/convention 1]
- [Essential rule/convention 2]
- [Essential rule/convention 3]

Keep the output concise and focused on the most important rules and conventions that AI coding agents need to know and enforce. Use only bullet points to minimize token usage and costs.
