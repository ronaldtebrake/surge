Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## jQuery coding standards

## jQuery coding standards

## Prefix variables that point to jQuery objects with a dollar sign($)
- In any part of your code it should be easy to understand which variables are jQuery objects and which are not.
- *Incorrect**
- When assigning a jQuery object to a variable:
- When assigning a jQuery object to a property:
- When assigning a jQuery object to a variable:
- When assigning a jQuery object to a property:

## Avoid compatibility issues
- jQuery is evolving quickly but attempts to maintain backward compatibility with previous releases. Although multiple jQuery versions are not officially supported within a single Drupal major release, many sites use the [jQuery update](http://drupal.org/project/issues/jquery_update) module to take advantage of performance and bug fixes offered by newer versions of jQuery. Custom modules using jQuery should keep up to date with syntax best-practices in order to avoid conflicts with updated versions.

## Chaining
- For chaining selector you can either use CSS method $(' a b > c') or JavaScript chaining $('a').find('b').children('c'). Second method is slightly faster([test](http://jsperf.com/jquery-chaning/2)). In both cases reduce the weight of selector(if possible). In case .children() and .find() will return the same results, use .find() method ([test](http://jsperf.com/jquery-chaning/2)).
- *Incorrect**

## Event Delegation
- Every event (e.g. click, mouseover, etc.) in JavaScript “bubbles” up the DOM tree to parent elements. This is incredibly useful when you want many elements to call the same function. Instead of binding an event listener function to all of them, you can bind it once to their parent, and have it figure out which node triggered the event.
- In examples of jQuery code, you may often see events simply `return false;` to prevent the default behavior of that event. This type of prevention is often [misused](http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/) and also prevents the "bubbling" propagation of the event. This effect is not always [desired](https://drupal.org/node/1749782). If you wish to either prevent the default behavior or stop propagation, they should be explicitly defined.
- *Incorrect**
- *Correct (Drupal 7)**
- *Correct (Drupal 8)**

## Functions
- Separate your functions into individual functions and call them when needed.
- *Incorrect**

## Context
- Always try to give your selectors a context. The default context will search the entire page's DOM. If the context is a cached selection, use find().
- *Incorrect**
- *Improved**

## Using #id or .class
- Finding elements by the tag ID is *much* faster ([test](http://jsperf.com/id-vs-class-vs-tag-selectors/2)) than by class name. If your target element appears on the page only once, select it by #id. In case when you have more than one, use class but descend from an #id. See the above [context](#context) code examples.

## jQuery.attr()
- *This applies only for D6 and D7** because D8 will ship with jQuery 1.9+ which instead uses .prop() for property.
- Wrong use of .attr is the cause of the many compatibility problems. Use booleans to set a property, not an empty string. Also, do not assume that property values that are returned are always booleans. `.attr('checked')` could return either `true` or `'checked'` depending on jQuery version and markup.
- *Incorrect**

## jQuery.each()
- This method is indeed very powerful (and appropriate) when dealing with existing instantiated jQuery objects and the need to iterate on them.
- It is often misused when needing to iterate over simple native JavaScript arrays or objects. Using native JavaScript `for` loops are *300-1000 times* faster than jQuery.each() ([test](http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-quickeach/83)).
- *Incorrect**

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Jquery Coding Standards

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
