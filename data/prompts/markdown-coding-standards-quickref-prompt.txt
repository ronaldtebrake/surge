I have a documentation page (the Drupal "Markdown Coding Standards" standards page) that describes rules or conventions. I want to convert that page into a clear section in AGENTS.md so that an AI coding agent can read and enforce those conventions.

Please do the following:

Read the source content I will provide.

Extract the key conventions / rules / guidelines (in bullet or list form).

Write a section suitable for AGENTS.md, with a heading like ## Markdown Coding Standards, followed by the rules in a concise, machine-friendly form.

Ensure the section is self-contained (i.e. an agent reading only AGENTS.md should understand the rules).

Use consistent formatting across sections (e.g. heading levels, bullet style).

## Requirements:

### Format & Structure:
1. **Use AGENTS.md format** - Create a section suitable for AGENTS.md
2. **Use bullet points** - Keep it scannable and concise
3. **Structure logically** - Group related guidelines together
4. **Use clear headers** - Make it easy to navigate

### Content Focus:
5. **Extract key conventions/rules** - Focus on the most important coding standards and conventions
6. **Be concise** - Avoid lengthy explanations, focus on actionable guidelines
7. **Prioritize AI-relevant content** - Rules that AI coding agents should follow and enforce
8. **Minimize token usage** - Use bullet points only, no examples or lengthy explanations

### AI Optimization:
9. **Make it actionable** - Each point should be something an AI can implement or enforce
10. **Use consistent formatting** - Standardize the format for easy parsing
11. **Focus on conventions** - Coding standards, naming conventions, best practices, rules
12. **Self-contained** - An agent reading only this section should understand the rules

### Output Format:
Generate an AGENTS.md section in this exact format:

## Markdown Coding Standards

### Rules
- [Essential rule/convention 1]
- [Essential rule/convention 2]
- [Essential rule/convention 3]

Keep the output concise and focused on the most important rules and conventions that AI coding agents need to know and enforce. Use only bullet points to minimize token usage and costs.
