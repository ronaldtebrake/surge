Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## Naming standards for services and extending Symfony

## Naming standards for services and extending Symfony

## Manipulating the Request object:
- Elements added to the attributes of the Request object by any Drupal module or service should have a "\_" prepended unless they come from the path.
- Only values that come from the path will have the "\_" omitted, for example, the path pattern /node/{node}.
- Drupal core and Symfony typically add some prefixed attributes that should not be overwritten by a contributed module. These include:
- (Note that \_account is being removed in [#2073531: Use current user service instead of \_account, remove \_account from the request object](/project/drupal/issues/2073531 "Status: Closed (fixed)").)
- and from Symfony\\Cmf\\Component\\Routing\\RouteObjectInterface:
- See the [the original change notice](/node/2083979).

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Naming Standards For Services And Extending Symfony

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
