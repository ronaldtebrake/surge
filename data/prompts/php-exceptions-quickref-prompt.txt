Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## Basic Exception Naming Conventions
- 1.  As Exceptions are classes, they should follow all [coding standards for object-oriented code](http://drupal.org/node/608152) like any other class.
- 2.  All Exceptions must end with the suffix "Exception".
- 3.  All Exceptions should include an appropriate message and should not be translated. Only messages from the install and update system are currently translated as they are user facing.
- 4.  The Exception's message should include a hint to the values that caused the exception.
- 1.  Formatting messages should be done by concatenating strings or using `sprintf()`.
- 2.  Values should be surrounded by single quotes.
- 3.  **DO NOT** translate the message.
- 4.  **DO NOT** use `SafeMarkup::format()`.
- 5.  Exception classes should be named for the subsystem to which they relate, and the type of error. That is, `[Subsystem][ErrorType]Exception`.

## Exception Subclasses
- The use of subclassed Exceptions is preferred over reusing a single generic Exception class with different error messages as different classes may then be caught separately.

## Example:
- See [the Drupal\\Core\\Entity\\Exception namespace](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/namespace/Drupal!Core!Entity!Exception/8.2.x) for real-life examples.

## Try-catch blocks
- Try-catch blocks should follow a similar line-breaking pattern to if-else statements, with each catch statement beginning a new line.

## Inheritance
- PHP requires that all exceptions inherit off of the Exception class, either directly or indirectly.
- When creating a new exception class, it should be named according to the subsystem they relate to and the error message they involve. If a given subsystem includes multiple exceptions, they should all extend from a common base exception. That allows for multiple catch blocks as necessary.

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Php Exceptions

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
