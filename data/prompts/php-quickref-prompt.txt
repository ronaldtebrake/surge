Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:
- The Drupal coding standards for PHP.
- PHP standards are enforced using [PHP\_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). The rules used are from that project as well as the [Drupal coder project](https://drupal.org/project/coder) and [Slevomat](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard).
- The Drupal Coding Standards apply to code within Drupal and its contributed modules.
- Standards for API documentation blocks in PHP code
- This page is intended to be a collection of the complete API documentation examples
- Standards having to do with namespaces
- Standards for services and Symfony usage
- Basic conventions, exception subclasses, try-catch blocks, inheritance
- Summary of how Drupal 8 uses the PSR-4 standard for namespace autoloading
- Standards for what to call delimiters and placeholders in code
- Adjusting the error reporting level

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Php

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
