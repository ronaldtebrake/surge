Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## Spelling

## Spelling
- Drupal Core uses US English spelling for all source code, including comments and names.
- Core code is automatically checked for spelling by [CSpell](https://cspell.org/).

## Spelling of CSpell
- For in line documentation settings use all lower case for cspell. For example, `// cspell:ignore.`

## Ignore word(s) in a file
- Use the `cspell:ignore` directive. The words are listed alphabetically with a single space between the words. Use multiple lines to meet the number of characters per line limit.

## Disable CSpell by line
- if it's not in English or a nonsense string (for example, a random string in a test) disable CSpell for that line. Note that `cspell` is lower case.

## Disable CSpell for multiple lines
- For multiple lines, use disable before the lines and enable after. Note that `cspell` is lower case.
- See the [cspell development tool page](/node/3352552) for more details.

## Related Content
- This section is intended to provide direction for Drupal.org content, particularly documentation and general information pages related to
- User Interface standards for Drupal.

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Spelling

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
