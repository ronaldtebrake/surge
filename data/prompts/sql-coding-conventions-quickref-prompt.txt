Convert the following Drupal coding standards bullet points into a clean, focused section for an Agents.md file.

The bullet points are already cleaned and contain only the essential coding standards. Your job is to organize them into a clear, concise format that AI coding agents can easily follow.

## Source Bullet Points:

## SQL coding conventions

## SQL coding conventions

## Reserved Words

## Drupal 8 and 9
- All identifiers in SQL query should be quoted. Table names are quoted using curly brackets, for example, `{table_name}`. All other identifiers are quoted using square brackets, for example, `[column_name]`.

## Drupal 7
- Don't use (ANSI) SQL / MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server / ... Reserved Words for column and/or table names. Even if this may work with your (MySQL) installation, it may not with others or with other databases. Some references:
- [(ANSI) SQL Reserved Words](/node/141051)
- MySQL Reserved Words: [5.1](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/reserved-words.html), [5.0](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/reserved-words.html), [3.23.x, 4.0, 4.1](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/reserved-words.html)
- [PostgreSQL Reserved Words](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/sql-keywords-appendix.html)
- [Oracle Reserved Words](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/ap_keywd.htm#i690190) (in particular UID is a problem in our context)
- [MS SQL Server Reserved Words](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189822.aspx)
- [DB2 Reserved Words](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.admin.doc/doc/r0001095.htm)
- Some commonly misused keywords: `TIMESTAMP, TYPE, TYPES, MODULE, DATA, DATE, TIME, ...`
- See also [\[bug\] SQL Reserved Words](http://drupal.org/node/371).

## Capitalization and user-supplied data
- Make SQL reserved words UPPERCASE. This is not a suggestion. Drupal db abstraction commands will fail if this convention is not followed.
- Make column and constraint names lowercase.
- Enclose each table name with `{}` (this allows Drupal to prefix table names).
- Variable arguments (which are often user-supplied) should be moved out of the query body and passed in as separate parameters to [`db_query()`](http://api.drupal.org/apis/db_query), [`db_query_range()`](http://api.drupal.org/apis/db_query_range), and [`db_query_temporary()`](http://api.drupal.org/apis/db_query_temporary), etc. The query body should instead contain placeholders specifying the type of each argument (`%d|%s|%|%f|%b`). This ensures that the data will be properly escaped and prevents SQL injection attacks.
- Preventing SQL injection is easy; db\_query provides a way to use parametrized queries. Drupal's database functions replace the sprintf-like placeholders with the properly escaped arguments in order of appearance:
- %d - integers
- %f - floats
- %s - strings, enclose in single quotes
- %b - binary data, do not enclose in single quotes
- % - replaced with %
- Read more about [Database Access](/node/101496)
- Literal (constant) arguments can either be included in the query body or handled in the same way as variable arguments.
- Any string literal or %s placeholder must be enclosed by single quotes: `'` . Never use double quotes.
- *NOTE: as of Drupal 6.x, table definitions and constraints (e.g. primary keys, unique keys, indexes) should be always handled by the [Schema API](/node/146843), which solves cross-database compatibility concerns automatically.**

## Naming
- Use singular nouns for table names since they describe the entity the table represents. Drupal 6.x mixed singular/plural usage and this convention changed for Drupal 7.x.
- It is a good practice to prefix table names with the module name to prevent possible namespace conflicts.
- Name every constraint (primary, foreign, unique keys) yourself. Otherwise, you'll see funny-looking system-generated names in error messages. This happened with the `moderation_roles` table which initially defined a key without explicit name as `KEY (mid)`. This got mysqldump'ed as `KEY mid (mid)` which resulted in a syntax error as `mid()` is a mysql function (see [\[bug\] mysql --ansi cannot import install database](/node/893)).
- Index names should begin with the name of the table they depend on, eg. `INDEX users_sid_idx`.
- *NOTE: as of Drupal 6.x, table definitions and constraints should be always handled by the Schema API.**

## Configure your Database server for standard compliance
- Most Database Servers use extension to standard SQL. However, many of them can be configured to run in a (more) standard compliant mode. Every developer is encouraged to use the mode most standard compliant to avoid sloppy coding and compatibility problems.
- Enable [ANSI](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-sql-mode.html#id2702339) and [Strict](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-sql-mode.html#id2702074) Mode
- Please help growing this list for other database servers!*

## Indentation
- Drupal does not have a standard method for indentation or formating of longer SQL queries on multiple lines. Some competing strategies include:
- or, using the concept of "rivers" and HEREDOC syntax

## Requirements:
- Extract only the essential coding standards and rules
- Use clear, actionable language that AI agents can implement
- Group related rules under appropriate subheadings
- Keep it concise - no examples or lengthy explanations
- Use consistent bullet point formatting
- Focus on what AI coding agents should do/avoid

## Output Format:
Generate a clean section in this format:

## Sql Coding Conventions

### [Subsection 1]
- [Essential rule 1]
- [Essential rule 2]

### [Subsection 2]  
- [Essential rule 3]
- [Essential rule 4]

Keep the output focused, actionable, and optimized for AI coding agents.
