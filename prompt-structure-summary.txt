```
## General Best Practices
- Drupal has made every effort to seamlessly build accessibility in Drupal Core
- Providing text alternatives (alt text) for non-text content, such as images, charts and graphs
- Providing accurate transcripts, captions, and descriptions for video
- Ensuring color choices have sufficient contrast to make it easier to read for users with visual impairments
- Testing to ensure the website is keyboard-navigable
- Using semantic HTML tags such as <h1>, <ul>, and <button> rather than <div>
- Defaulting to using HTML whenever possible and using WAI-ARIA modestly
